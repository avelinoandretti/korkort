__Körkort Studieguide i Markdown__

__Swedish driving license study guide in Markdown__

__Guia de estudio para licencia de manejo sueca en Markdown__

The purpose is to create a community based study guides in several languages. If you see grammar, spelling errors or inaccuracies, or incomplete information, please go ahead and make the changes and a pull request.

Contributions are welcome as I'm not native speaker of all of these languages.
 * Style
 * Grammar
 * Spelling
 * Content
 * Corrections
 * New Languages

The guide is organized as follows:
 * A directory for each language (using ISO-IEC standard)
   * sv
   * en
   * es
   * ...
 * Each language directory has an index README.md that links to the chapters in the guide
 * Chapters are named with the characters "ch" followed by the chapter using two digits, using zero as the first digit for chapters prior to chapter 10
   
   This way the file listing will show the right order; e.g.
   * ch01.md
   * ch02.md
   * ch03.md
   * ...
   
     etc.
