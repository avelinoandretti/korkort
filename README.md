__Swedish driving license study guide in Markdown__

__Guia de estudia para licencia de manejo sueca en Markdown__

The purpose is to create a community based study guides in several languages.

The guide is organized as follows:
 * A directory for each language (using ISO-IEC standard)
   * sv
   * en
   * es
   * ...
 * Each language directory has an index README.md that links to the chapters in the guide
 * Chapters are named with the characters "ch" followed by the chapter using two digits, using zero as the first digit for chapters prior to chapter 10
   
   This way the file listing will show the right order; e.g.
   * ch01.md
   * ch02.md
   * ch03.md
   * ...
   
     etc.
